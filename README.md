# 🌱 My Spring Framework Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress as I learn and practice **Spring Framework** and **Spring Boot**.  
I am exploring the core features of the Spring ecosystem, building example applications, and applying concepts in a real project: **EazyByte School** – a student registration system.

---

## 📖 Overview

Spring is one of the most popular Java frameworks for building enterprise-grade applications.  
My learning process includes:
1. Studying **Spring Core** concepts like Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC).
2. Implementing **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** to handle cross-cutting concerns.
3. Building REST APIs using **Spring MVC**.
4. Integrating with databases using **Spring Data JPA** and Hibernate.
5. Applying best practices for testing using JUnit and Mockito.
6. Packaging and deploying applications with Spring Boot.

## 📌 Current Project: EazyByte School
**EazyByte School** is a Spring Boot application for registering and managing students.  

**Features:**
- Register new students with details such as name, email, and course.
- View registered students.
- Update student details.
- Delete student records.
- Store data in a relational database (MySQL or H2).

**Tech Stack:**
- Java 17+
- Spring Boot 3+
- Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)
- MySQL / H2 Database
- Maven

**Folder:** `/projects/eazybyte-school`
